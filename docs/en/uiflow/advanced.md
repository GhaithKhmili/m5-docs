# ESP-NOW

#### Function Description

>ESP-NOW is a short-range, low-power communication protocol that enables multiple devices to communicate without Wi-Fi. This protocol is similar to the low-power 2.4GHz wireless connection found in wireless miceâ€”devices are paired before communicating. After pairing, the connections between devices are continuous, peer-to-peer, and do not require a handshake protocol.

><img src="image\ESP_now\esp_now_01.webp" width="60%">

* __Get mac addr__
Get the mac address of this machine.

* __Add peer ff as id__
Add the specified mac address and set it to id

* __Set pmk__
Set the pairing key

* __Broadcast data__
Broadcast specified data

* __Receive mac_addr data__
Receive data, get the sender's mac address and the data content carried

* __After send message flag__
Send a callback function, automatically execute the callback function after executing the send message, and return whether the flag bit flag is successfully sent. The success is True and the failure is False.

* __Send message id with data__
Send data to the device with the specified id.


#### Instructions

<h3><mark>Receiver</mark></h3>

> Display the local mac address on the screen, use the data receiving block and create two variables for receiving the sender's address and data content. The data is processed inside the receiving block function for display or judgment and other operations. For example, the following program controls the LED light switch by judging whether the received data is "1".

__Note: The created variable name is not allowed to be consistent with the parameter name, ie variables with the names "addr" and "data" are not allowed to be used for data acquisition __

><img src="image\ESP_now\esp_now_02.webp" width="40%">

<h3><mark>Sender</mark></h3>

> Add the mac address of the receiving device, fill in the sent data content in the sending program, select the id of the receiving device. Use the button program to control the data transmission. Using the callback function can help us determine whether the data is successfully sent from the machine. We need to use a variable to get its return result.

__Note: The created variable name is not allowed to be consistent with the parameter name, ie variables with the name "flag" are not allowed to be used for data acquisition __

><img src="image\ESP_now\esp_now_03.webp" width="40%">

>Complete the program editing, respectively run the receiver and transmitter programs, you can achieve ESP-NOW short-range wireless communication.


# MQTT communication

#### What is MQTT?

>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a "lightweight" communication protocol based on publish/subscribe (publish/subscribe) mode.

> The protocol was built on the TCP/IP protocol and was released by IBM in 1999.

>The biggest advantage of MQTT is that it can provide real-time and reliable message service for connecting remote devices with very little code and limited bandwidth.

>As a low-overhead, low-bandwidth instant messaging protocol, it has a wide range of applications in the Internet of Things, small devices, and mobile applications.

#### UIFlow and MQTT

>In UIFlow, we can use MQTT function to realize communication and interaction between two or more COREs, thus achieving powerful remote control functions.

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT.webp" width="50%"> 


# MQTT server

* __Select MQTT Service__

> To use the MQTT protocol for data interaction, you need server support. There are many third-party server platforms to choose from. The platform we demonstrate here is CloudMQTT.

>When you have created service support on the platform, you will get some configuration information, such as server address, username, password, etc., which will be used in UIFlow's MQTT block.

><img src="/image/MQTT/info.webp" width="50%"> 



* __MQTT fuction__

> In the advanced functions of UIFlow, you can find the MQTT function block. We can simply understand the MQTT protocol as two links, "Publish" and "Subscribe".

> When the publisher posts a message, the subscriber will get this information to enable communication between devices

><img src="/image/MQTT/UIFlow_MQTT.webp" width="50%">



# Initialization procedure

* __MQTT configuration block__

>Add an MQTT configuration block and connect to the Setup block

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT_Start1.webp" width="50%"> 

* __information to fill in__

> Fill in the server information on your personal or third-party server platform to prepare for the next connection

# attention

* When you have multiple devices at the same time, the ID name (the ID below is "M5stack") is not allowed to be duplicated with other options in the configuration information, and it is not allowed to duplicate the IDs of other devices. At the same time, the same server In the device with the same ID name, only one online is allowed.

* MQTT program must be downloaded to use!

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT_Start2.webp" width="50%"> 

* __MQTT Start__

>Add a Start block below the MQTT configuration block, which means that it will start running after the configuration information.

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT_Start3.webp" width="50%"> 



# Publish

#### Function Description

>When the A button is pressed, a message is posted (the subject is "RGB" and the content is "open")

>When the B button is pressed, a message is posted (the subject is "RGB" and the content is "close")

><img src="/image/MQTT/Publish2.webp" width="50%"> 


# Subscribe

#### Function Description

>Subscribe subscription refers to the process of receiving data in the communication. When the publisher publishes the information, the subscriber will automatically receive the subscribed topic (message), message content (msg)

* __Subscribe "topic"__

><img src="/image/MQTT/Subscribe1.webp" width="50%"> 

>Set the topic to subscribe to

* __Get topic data "content" (msg)__

><img src="/image/MQTT/Subscribe2.webp" width="50%"> 

>Get the message content under this subscription

#### Instructions

> Add a Subscribe block, fill in the topic to be subscribed, use the Get topic data block to get, and process the analysis, for example:

>When an "open" is obtained from Publish, the RGB bar is lit, and when "close" is obtained, the RGB bar is extinguished.

><img src="/image/MQTT/Subscribe3.webp" width="50%"> 


# Use Cases

#### Implementation function

> Use a CORE to program a simple use case to verify functionality, itâ€™s not inly a publisher (Publish), but a subscriber (Subscribe) as well

* __complete program__

><img src="/image/MQTT/Example1.webp" width="50%"> 

#### Instructions

>When the A button is pressed, a message is posted (the subject is "RGB", the content is "open"), and the RGB bar lights up.
