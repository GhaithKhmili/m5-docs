## Description

**SG90 Servo Holder** is a 9g servo with LEGO fixed bracket.There are 180 ° and 360 ° specifications.The independent design of the fixed bracket can be easily disassembled, and the product is completely designed according to the LEGO standard unit,so that you can easily combine with LEGO series products, play unlimited creativity.The rudder plate is designed to be reopened without screw connection. It can be directly connected with LEGO parts. No matter 180 ° or 360 ° servo, it is very easy for beginners to use.Even if you don't know  how to program, you can easily drive it with UIFlow.There is no need to use a dedicated servo-drive board with feedback control and a complicated gearbox. Any common pwm driver or a microcontroller can easily control this servo. Compared to driving a stepper motor, a servo is much simpler to use. You can use it to do interesting small projects requiring angular movement and/or control.The commonly used pulse width is 1-2ms (-90° position - 1ms , 0° position - 1.5ms, 90° position - 2ms)，working at 50Hz. Going beyond the specified pulse width range will damage the servo.If you feel that the cable is not long enough, you can purchase the servo extension cable to extend it. 180° servo has three connecting wires,yellow is signal line, brown is GND, red is 5V, 180° servo can only control angle.The 360° servo has two connecting lines, red is 5V, black is GND, 360° servo can't control the angle, but you can adjust the speed by controlling PWM.When using the steering gear, pay attention to the power supply current and voltage to prevent burnout.
