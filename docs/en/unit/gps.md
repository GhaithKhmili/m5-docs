## Description

This is the M5Unit version of **GPS**, integrates a Zhongke Weibeidou navigation chip **AT6558** and a amplification chip **MAX2659** used for amplifying antenna signal.

**AT6558** is highly performance, supports many types of satellite navigation system,able to receive satellite signals on 56 channels GNSS signal from 6 satellite navigation system, joint location, navigation, timing and more.
The module is able to obtain accurate global location information.  quick and accurate positioning for anywhere in the city, in the canyon, under the overhead, and inside the car.

The module can be widely used in vehicle monitoring, bus reporting, car navigation, onboard navigation, notebook navigation and other products.

You can plug it into port C on M5core via GROVE cable, which is a standard UART interface.

UART settings :
- Baudrate(**default: 9600bps**)
- Start bits(1 bit)
-  Stop bits(1 bit)
-  Parity(no)

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

?>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)

## Example

### 1. Arduino IDE

*To get the complete code `GPSRaw.ino`, please click [here](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-ProductExampleCodes/tree/master/Unit/GPS).*

```arduino
#include <M5Stack.h>

/* By default, GPS is connected with M5Core through UART2 */
HardwareSerial GPSRaw(2);

void setup() {
  M5.begin();
  GPSRaw.begin(9600);// GPS init
  Serial.println("hello");
  termInit();
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if(Serial.available()) {
    int ch = Serial.read();
    GPSRaw.write(ch);
  }
  if(GPSRaw.available()) {
    int ch = GPSRaw.read();// read GPS information
    Serial.write(ch);
    termPutchar(ch);
  }
}
```

After burnt the example code `GPSRaw.ino`, m5core and PC serial terminal will display following information
