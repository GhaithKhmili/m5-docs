## Description

OP.90 and OP.180 are two limit switches with different orientation placement. Build with a ITR9606, which is consist of an infrared emitting diode and a silicon phototransistor.
<br>
They are used for controlling machinery as part of a control system, as a safety interlock, or to count objects passing a point.A limit switch is an electromechanical device that consists of an actuator mechanically linked to a set of contacts. When an object comes into contact with the actuator, the device operates the contacts to make or break an electrical connection
<br>
The actuator of this Unit is consist of a pair of IR part, emitter side and receiver side(silicon phototransistor). The IR emitter will keep sending IR wave while the receiver will keep detecting the IR wave.  The IR is directly emitted from one side to another side, so if there's no object in between, the receiver side would get the IR signal. This is how it detecting a break an electrical connection.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

?>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)

  M5.Lcd.println("90/180 OPTICAL");

  pinMode(36,INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  M5.Lcd.setCursor(80, 120, 4);
  M5.Lcd.printf("ir receive: %d",digitalRead(36));
