## Description

**JOYSTICK**,  we have two types of JOYSTICKs one is build on a panle compatible with FACES Kit, this is the M5Unit version of **JOYSTICK**

JOYSTICK is very similar to the 'analog' joystick on PS2 (PlayStation 2) controllers. The X and Y axes are two 10k potentiometers which control 2D movement by generating analog signals. The joystick also has a push button that could be used for special applications. Therefore, the entire Unit can output X-Y motion signals in both directions and Z direction.

As designed in the schematic, the Joystick X dimension is connected to pin A0 of MEGA328, the Joystick Y dimension is connected to pin A1 on MEGA328, the Joystick Z dimension is connected to pin A2 on MEGA328.

This Unit communicates with the M5Core via the GROVE A interface. It's I2C address is 0x52. By reading the data transferred from JOSTICK, you can obtain the motion information of JOYSTICK.

## Product Features

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

?>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)
