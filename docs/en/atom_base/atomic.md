## Description

**ATOMIC**  is a DIY Proto Kit specially adapted to Atom series, which is convenient for users to design small circuits or external hardware by themselves. It can be stacked with Atom directly through 9 pin arrangement. Two proto blank boards are provided in the kit, each of which provides more than 60 hole positions to meet the spatial layout requirements of users. A pair of 3.96 * 4P seats are contained to make the external electrical connection more reliable. The shell adopts the perforated design, which can meet the needs of heat dissipation and provide the use of non-closed space such as temperature and humidity measurement.
