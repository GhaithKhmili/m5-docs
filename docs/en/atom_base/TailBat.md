## Description

**TailBat** is an external battery accessory designed for ATOM. Inserting the tail of atom can directly supply power for ATOM, which is convenient for users to use in mobile scenes. There is a switch button on the front of TailBat, which contains 190mah battery inside. It is controlled by the power management chip IP5303. When the power is turned on, the red indicator light is on. The operation method is the same as that of m5stack core: Click to turn on the power, double-click to turn off the power. Because tailbat has made a straight through design for the interface on the basis of adding batteries, it will not affect the original GROVE Connection mode and USB function. The built-in battery can only be charged through the typec interface, not through the grove interface.
