## Description

**TailBat** is an external battery accessory designed for M5ATOM. If the TailBat module is inserted into the M5ATOM it can directly supply power to the  M5ATOM, enabling the M5ATOM to be used in mobile applications. The TailBat contains a 190mah battery and features a physical button. It is controlled by the power management chip IP5303. When the power is turned on, the red indicator light will turn on. The operation method is the same as that of M5Stack Core: Click to turn on the power, double-click to turn off the power. Since the TailBat has been designed simply to add battery power, it will not affect the original GROVE Connection mode and USB functionality. The built-in battery can only be charged through the USB typeC interface, not through the grove interface.
