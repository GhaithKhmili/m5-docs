## Description

**ATOMHUB** is a DIY proto board suite that adapts to ATOM series. Users can build circuits or connect peripherals according to their own needs to satisfy the functions and requirements of specific scenarios. Considering the various possibilities of user connection, atomhub provides a wealth of interfaces, including VH3.96 Interface, DC5V power interface, grove interface, and all kinds of openings are reserved on the shell to facilitate user wiringã€‚A variety of mounting holes are designed on the back of the fuselage, which not only support the traditional hanging holes and screw fixing holes, but also support the fixation of slide rail clamps.Built in proto circuit board, main circuit space layout 45x35x20mm.With atomhub, you can make your own hardware devices at will, such as connecting batteries by yourself, or integrating micro air pump + air pressure sensor to make a blood pressure meter, or even building a positioning and tracking system with GPS + NB-IoT module.

## USAGE

According to your own needs to build the circuit prototype, welding the corresponding components,through the vh-3.96 interface to connect external electrical equipment.You can also choose to purchase round waterproof connector connecting cable by yourself.If you need to supply power through external power supply, you can choose to supply power directly to ATOM through USB; Or weld the DC 5V connector and connect the positive and negative poles to the corresponding pins of ATOM. If the input voltage is higher than 5V, you need to build your own voltage step-down circuit.If you need to use GROVE port, connect the padbreakpoint corresponding to the pin number you determined to use.

## Example

### 1. Arduino
A remote control circuit is built in AtomHUB by using the step-down circuit and relay. The control pin of the relay is GPIO21, which is powered by an external power supply. It is connected to Apple's Homekit application through WiFi for remote control. Open the Homekit for manual connection. The default password is 11111111. Use the Siri voice remote control or manual button for remote control.
