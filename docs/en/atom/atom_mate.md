## Description

**ATOM MATE** is a DIY expansion kit specially designed for the M5ATOM family. The kit contains 3 kinds of accessories. AtomPin is a pin adapter board that can expand the bottom pins of the M5Atom from all sides, making it easier to build circuits on the breadboard. With a special bracket, you can easily attach M5Atom without affecting the use of the pins. AtomHat is an adapter board for adapting the M5StickC Hat series of products for use with the M5Atom. If you already have some HAT accessories, you can directly use the AtomHat adapter to reuse them with M5Atom. There is a cross shaped hole on the bottom which can be connected to Lego, allowing for easy mounting onto Lego projects.
