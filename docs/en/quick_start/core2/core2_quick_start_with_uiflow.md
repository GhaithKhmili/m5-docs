?> When first burning or the firmware program runs abnormally, you can click "Erase" to erase the flash memory. In the subsequent firmware update, there is no need to erase again, otherwise the saved Wi-Fi information will be deleted and the API Key will be refreshed.


## Configure WIFI

> UIFlow provides both offline and web version of the programmer. When using the web version, we need to configure a WiFi connection for the device. The following describes two ways to configure WiFi connection for the device (Burn configuration and AP hotspot configuration).

### Burn configuration WiFi(recommend)

?> UIFlow-1.5.4 and versions above can write WiFi information directly through M5Burner.

<img src="assets/img/quick_start/m5stickcplus/burner_wifi.webp" width="70%">

### AP hotspot configuration WiFi

> 1. Press and hold the power button on the left to turn on the machine. If WiFi is not configured, the system will automatically enter the network configuration mode when it is turned on for the first time. Suppose you want to re-enter the network configuration mode after running other programs, you can refer to the operation below. After the UIFlow Logo appears at startup, quickly click the Home button (center M5 button) to enter the configuration page. Press the button on the right side of the fuselage to switch the option to Setting, and press the Home button to confirm. Press the right button to switch the option to WiFi Setting, press the Home button to confirm, and start the configuration.

> 2. After successfully connecting to the hotspot with your mobile phone, open the mobile phone browser to scan the QR code on the screen or directly access __192.168.4.1__, enter the page to fill in your personal WIFI information, and click Configure to record your WiFi information. The device will restart automatically after successfully configuring and enter programming mode.

?> Note: Special characters such as "space" are not allowed in the configured WiFi information.

## Network Programming Mode and API KEY

#### Enter network programming mode

?> Network programming mode is a docking mode between M5 device and UIFlow web programming platform. The screen will show the current network connection status of the device. When the indicator is green, it means that you can receive program push at any time. Under default situation, after the first successful WiFi network configuration, the device will automatically restart and enter the network programming mode. If you do not know how to re-enter the programming mode after running other applications, you can refer to the following operations.

> restarting, press button A in the main menu interface to select the programming mode and wait till the right indicator of the network indicator to turn green in the programming mode page. Access UIFlow programming page by visiting [flow.m5stack.com](http://flow.m5stack.com/) on a computer browser.

#### API KEY Pairing

> API KEY is the communication credential for M5 devices when using UIFlow web programming. By configuring the corresponding API KEY on the UIFlow side, the program can be pushed for the specific device. The user needs to visit [flow.m5stack.com](http://flow.m5stack.com/) in the computer web browser to enter the UIFlow programming page. Click the setting button in the menu bar at the upper right corner of the page, enter the API Key on the corresponding device, select the hardware used, click OK to save and wait till it prompts successfully connecting.
